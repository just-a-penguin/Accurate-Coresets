Originally, coresets are designed to preserve the structure and characteristics of data. For standard coresets, there's a trade-off between the size of the coresets and the accuracy with which it preserves the shape of the data.
There are cases in which we want to preserve some of the exact characteristics or some particular properties of the data without any change in loss due to this summarization.
In these cases, we use something called accurate coresets.Â 




Accurate Coresets in Regularized Regression and lambda values: 
One of these cases could be that of regularized regression.
Regularized regression. Regularized regression is one of the most used techniques for predictive models, as it prevents overfitting. In regularized regression, we have a loss function that consists of two parts: the first part is the loss function that we want to minimize, and the second part is the regularization term that we want to keep small. The regularization term is multiplied by a parameter called lambda. The lambda parameter controls the trade-off between the loss function and the regularization term. The higher the lambda value, the more the regularization term is penalized, and the more the model is regularized. The lower the lambda value, the less the regularization term is penalized, and the more the model is allowed to fit the data. The lambda value is usually chosen by cross-validation, but it can also be chosen by other methods, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The lambda value is crucial for the performance of the model, as it controls the complexity of the model and prevents overfitting. The lambda value is usually chosen by cross-validation, but it can also be chosen by other methods, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
